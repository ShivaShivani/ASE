**Why adding Google Authentication into your app will benefit you and your users?**

  - **Improve conversions:** Help people log into your app quickly without having to register a new user and remember another username and password.
  - **One login across every device:** Make it easy for people to log in and access their info across multiple platforms and devices.
  - **Build a trusted relationship:** Give people control over the info they share with your app.
  - **Access profile info:** like picture, gender, age, name, without having to ask for it.


## Google Authentication

There are different ways to integrate Google authentication into your Ionic app. However, not all of them use the native approach which uses Google+ app to perform the login instead of opening a popup requesting users to enter their credentials to login to google before granting access to your app.

The way it works for hybrid apps to use native api’s and sdk’s is simple, you need a piece (typically a PhoneGap/Cordova plugin) that connects native api’s and sdk’s with the javascript environment where the hybrid apps run. In this case we are going to use a great cordova plugin to interact with the native google sdk.
